# My Dotfiles

### What software do I use???
- *Text Editor-* VS Code usually, but sometimes vim when I want to feel like a l33t hax0r
- *Terminal Emulator-* Alacritty
- *Linux Distro-* Arch Linux
- *Window Manager-* Herbstluftwm

### What are my plans for the future of this config?
- I wanna add some bootstrap scripts for when I want to reinstall Arch.
- Purge my setup of all proprietary and non-free dependencies, if they exist.
- add some firefox custom css when I set that up.
