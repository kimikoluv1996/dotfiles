I'm in my Emacs era.

## About this Config
obviously this is my config for Arch linux and openbox the window manager.
Don't use this config. Seriously.
Not because it's super private or anything or I object to using other
peoples' configs, but because this setup sucks balls Lol.
Or at least it's very unfinished at least for now.
So for your sake, don't use it. 
It's licenced under the GPL so this is more of just
a suggestion tho...

### What software do I use???
- *Text Editor-* Emacs -- _I'm a major Emacs fangirl_
- *Terminal Emulator-* Alacritty
- *Linux Distro-* Arch
- *Window Manager-* Openbox

### What are my plans for the future of this config?
- I wanna add some bootstrap scripts for when I want to reinstall Arch.
- Purge my setup of all proprietary and non-free dependencies, if they exist.
- add some firefox custom css when I set that up.
